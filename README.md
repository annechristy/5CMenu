5C Menu DOCUMENTATION
---------------------
5C Menu is an Android application that allows users to search meals at the 
Claremont Colleges dining halls from their Android devices. Users can choose 
a dining hall and view the most current meal selections at that dining hall.
Although there are some existing apps for this purpose, the only Android 
applications are not currently functional.


INSTALLATION
------------
We recommend that users obtain the app from the Google Play store.

If you are working with the source code or an APK, we recommend connecting the 
device to a computer and uploading the application from there.


USE
---
Open the application by touching the 5C Menu icon on the app screen. When the 
home screen is finished loading, select one of the seven dining halls from the 
list. When the Menu Page opens, scroll through the list of menu items.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If the internet came disconnected during the use of the app, or if the menu 
page does not load correctly, try returning to the home screen. If the loading
box appears, then the app is trying to connect to the internet again. If this
fails, try exiting the app completely and then reopening the application.
